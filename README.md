# BuildExpoApk

It is a tool i made to build an Expo APK locally, without using the cloud service and avoiding to wait even hours to build just a test APK.

In order to use it you need to have:
  1) an expo account 
  2) download your own keystore files from the expo-cli
  3) have the expo-cli and turtle-cli packages
  4) have python3 installed
